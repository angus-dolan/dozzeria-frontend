# dozzeria-frontend

Vue.js and TailwindCSS frontend built to test Tailwind's new <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode">dark mode feature</a>.

Inspiration came from my obsession for making pizza. I may add a Firebase or Express backend to this in the future and use as a pizza blog üçï.
